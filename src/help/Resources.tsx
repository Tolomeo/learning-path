      Every resource is marked with a label indicating its type, giving
      indication on the organisation of the resource itself.
      <br /> Many resources have more than one type.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      There are several resource types, for different formats:

    {Object.entries(resourceTypes).map(([resourceTypeId, resourceType]) => (

      The pathâ€™s resources are suggestions.
      <br />
      Feel free to swap any of them with alternatives found in the{' '}
      <b>There&apos;s more</b> section, if those happened to feel more
      enjoyable.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Some resources could present overlapping or repetition at times. It&apos;s
      okay to take only what fits best in one&apos;s own learning journey.
