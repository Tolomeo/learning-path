# The learning path

Static website containing lists of URLs which contents are helpful to learn about several technologies.

## About The Project

At its core, this project is a collection of online free resources gathered and organised in the form of educational paths.
<br/>
Each path guides you through the journey of learning a new technology, from basic concepts to advanced topics.
<br/>
The final aim is to provide a valid alternative to similar paid offers, relying on free online resources only.
<br/>
If this project manages to help anyone learning something, I will see it as a success.
